Useful mtr command. By default ICMP (ping) packages by increase the TTL (Time-to-live) for each package, allowing to test each hop. Nice interactive mode with quick options to switch between settings: for example pressing "d" allows you to toggle between display modes. Press "s" to change the package size (default is 64 bytes). Press "i" to change the interval (default 1 per second). Press "u" to switch from ICMP Ping packages to UDP packages instead. Etc. etc.
