Useful mtr command. By default ICMP (ping) packages by increase the TTL (Time-to-live) for each package, allowing to test each hop. Nice interactive mode with quick options to switch between settings: for example pressing "d" allows you to toggle between display modes. Press "s" to change the package size (default is 64 bytes). Press "i" to change the interval (default 1 per second). Press "u" to switch from ICMP Ping packages to UDP packages instead. Etc. etc.

You can also start `mtr` with several options if you wish like `-n` will not resolve the hostnames (so no DNS calls) and `-r` will generate a report after 10 packages. Or `-i 0.1` will increase the interval from the default 1 second to 0.1 second in this example. THere are any more options like `-m 4` will not hop futher then 4 hops max.
