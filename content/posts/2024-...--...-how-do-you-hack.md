Sometimes I get the question: how can I "hack"? Hacker is a very general term. There is a clear difference between a **hacker** or a **cracker**. That's why I start with explaining these terms. Then I go deeper into why people hack or crack.

Finally, I show you some examples of how you can "hack".

## Hacker vs Cracker

A hacker is a general term that is often used in the news or in newspapers. But in fact, a **hacker** (also known as _white-hat hacker_) is a person who makes all kinds of things to find vulnerabilities in systems. A hacker also has programming knowledge in programming languages such as: C, C++, assembly and Java. A hacker can also be hired by companies to test their security systems.

A **cracker** (also known as _black-hat hacker_), is a person with (much) computer knowledge, with the goal to break into computer systems or internet security. A cracker breaks into systems for criminal gain. A cracker generally has little programming knowledge and therefore mostly use automated programs that do their work for them. A cracker also knows that he/she breaks the law, he/she will then mostly be caught by using skills and experience.

Crackers can crack systems with various underlying motivations; they can crack for profit, businesses they believe in, general evilness or just because they like it.

Both hackers and crackers can try to gain illegal or legal access to a computer network. The main difference is the knowledge difference between a hacker or a cracker.

People will often be a combination of both, that is called a _gray-hat hacker_. In fact, you are sometimes a cracker and/or a hacker. So you can find a vulnerability in software or a website. Instead of using it for your own benefit (that would then be _black-hat_), you share this information publicly. Other hackers can then use that information at that moment.
