DLRMs.. (deep learning recommendation model)

Age of ultra ethernet for running high AI load in data centers. And Ultra accelerator Link (UALink).

https://www.broadcom.com/blog/the-age-of-ultra-ethernet:

```
While Ethernet offers excellent performance for existing workloads, the network demands for AI training and inference continue to evolve. For example, in 2020, the large language model (LLM) GPT-3 was state-of-the-art with 175 billion parameters. The next generation GPT-4 is expected to increase this scale by more than five times to one trillion parameters. Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) now have many trillion parameters with further growth expected. The compute and networking infrastructure required to train and infer results from these models must evolve to reflect the scale, diversity of communication patterns, and variety of computational methods employed.

Accelerating the evolution of AI (and HPC) networks is the reason UEC was formed. The goals of UEC include the ability to scale to a huge number of endpoints, up to 1,000,000 nodes in one training cluster. The UEC transport will improve network efficiency by enabling traffic multipathing/spraying and congestion notification optimized for AI traffic. Additionally, recognizing that not every company has a dedicated team of engineers available to tune the network and software for each AI training job, one of the goals of UEC is to simplify network management by enabling configuration-free, end-to-end congestion control. UEC will also simplify software development by providing streamlined application program interfaces (APIs) for AI and HPC.

Broadcom has already embraced several UEC goals by, for example, supporting traffic multipathing/spraying and end-to-end congestion control in the Jericho3-AI fabric. This fabric is available today with huge scale, supporting AI clusters of 32,000 nodes with 800GbE per endpoint. Similarly, Tomahawk 5 provides multipathing, load balancing and improved congestion management with its Cognitive Routing capabilities. Broadcom is contributing technology to UEC to enable improvements in all aspects of the network stack.
