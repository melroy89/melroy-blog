Not really "AI", but LLMs..

Talk about:

- The downsides of AI, people trusting the AI and not doing their own research. It often returns an incorrect and wrong answer especially on data it wasn't trained on or missing from the training dataset.
- Large amount of content gathered by AI companies. Even not following the law and licenses.
- OpenAI and it's monopoly is a bad thing.
- Host your own Ollama instance with Open WebUI.
- Furthermore, the AI has is very biased, politically and in other views of the world. And since these AIs just give you a single answer, people might think that is this the only truth.
- But just like journalism a story always have two sides. If people get lazy with ChatGPT or Bing AI, people might stop doing proper research and make up their own mind.
- Show the good and the bad... Just as a simple tool it could be useful. But it can't replace human intelligence for sure.
