Most of the people know I'm using Telegram. But I never explained the reasons why I use Telegram. Let me explain why I think you should also use Telegram. Telegram is an alternative of WhatsApp.  
Read the full article, and be amazed by the features of Telegram.

## Open & Free

First things first. [Telegram](https://telegram.org/dl) has an [open API interface](https://core.telegram.org/api), meaning the clients are also open-source. And free to use, no adds, and easy to use.

You can use the telegram chat messenger application on your mobile (Android/iOS), a great [desktop app](https://desktop.telegram.org/) (Linux, Windows and Mac OS X) and a [web client](https://web.telegram.org).

## Secure & features

Telegram has peer to peer **encryption (_secret chats_)**, nice _stickers_, built-in _voice calling_ and even support _self-\_\_destructive messages_. It's so safe to use it, they even brought outside [multiple bounties up to $300.000](https://telegram.org/blog/cryptocontest-ends), but nobody never won (meaning the program or protocol is not cracked). Can you can send messages to yourself including images & files. In short you have an **unlimited** cloud storage location for free!

Telegram messages are synced automatically between all devices / clients. The messages can be changed after you send it to correct a spelling mistake for example. You can even remove a message after you send it (at both sides!). It has even an in-app browser, which opens your content very fast.

It supports bots, so you can [write your own chat bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots)! Nice bots are available, to name a few: [HotOrBot](https://telegram.me/hotorbot), [ImageBot](https://telegram.me/imagebot), [YoutubeBot](https://telegram.me/youtube), [GifBot](https://t.me/gif), [OtoutoBot](https://telegram.me/otouto), [SpotifyBot](https://telegram.me/spotybot), and [IMDbBot](https://telegram.me/imdb).

## Groups & Channels

Moreover, Telegram supports so called supergroups. Which are big chat groups upto _100.000 members_ in 1 group chat. Or channels for broadcasting to **unlimited** audiences. 
There are plenty of Telegram groups and channels available for all kind of different topics. Helpful cryptocurrency group: [Crypto Currency Republic](https://t.me/cryptocurrencyrepublic).

Or channels like: [Netflix](https://t.me/netflix), [Crypto Alerts channel](https://t.me/crypto_exchange_updates), [new daily music](https://telegram.me/daily_music) or just [find the channel where are you looking for](https://t.me/tchannelsbot).

Last but not least the servers of Telegram are hosted in Berlin covered by the European legislation, where as WhatsApp runs in America. With the legislations of America.
