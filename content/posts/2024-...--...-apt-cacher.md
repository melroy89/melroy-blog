Changing `acng.conf` config:

```
# Updated config to use another directory for cache
#
CacheDir: /media/data_extra/apt-cacher-ng

# Log file directory, can be set empty to disable logging
#
LogDir: /var/log/apt-cacher-ng

# A place to look for additional configuration and resource files if they are not
# found in the configuration directory
#
SupportDir: /usr/lib/apt-cacher-ng

# TCP server port for incoming http (or HTTP proxy) connections.
# Can be set to 9999 to emulate apt-proxy. Value of 0 turns off TCP server
# (SocketPath must be set in this case).
#
Port:3142

# Repository remapping. See manual for details.
# In this example, some backends files might be generated during package
# installation using information collected on the system.

# Days before considering an unreferenced file expired (to be deleted).

# still useful package files.

ExThreshold: 45

# Precache a set of files referenced by specified index files. This can be used
# to create a partial mirror usable for offline work. There are certain limits
# and restrictions on the path specification, see manual and the cache control
# web site for details. A list of (maybe) relevant index files could be
# retrieved via "apt-get --print-uris update" on a client machine.

# Allow data pass-through mode for certain hosts when requested by the client
# using a CONNECT request. This is particularly useful to allow access to SSL
# sites (https proxying). The string is a regular expression which should cover
# the server name with port and must be correctly formated and terminated.
#
PassThroughPattern: .*

# By default, if a remote suddenly reconnects, ACNG tries at least two times to
# redownload from the same or different location (if known).
DlMaxRetries: 10
```

But also setting: `PassThroughPattern: .*` to allow CONNECT to any HTTPS remotes. This can be set in either `acng.conf` directly or part of `/etc/apt-cacher-ng/zz_debconf.conf`.

https://wiki.debian.org/AptCacherNg

Configure client manually by setting the proxy in a new file: `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/00aptproxy`, with the content:

```
Acquire::http::Proxy "http://192.168.1.42:3142";
```

Where `192.168.1.42` is the IP address of the APT Cacher NG server.

Introduce new mirror files in `/usr/lib/apt-cacher-ng` directroy. Eg. `/usr/lib/apt-cacher-ng/linuxmint_mirrors` with a list of mirror URLs of Linux Mint.
