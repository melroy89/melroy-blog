i3, Awesome, Xmod, dmw, what the hack are we talking about? I know that most people are not familiar with 1 of these names. However, they are all very powerful and advanced **window managers** for GNU/Linux (not to be confused with Windows ðŸ˜‰ ).

## What are Window Managers?

Window Managers (WM), also known as window managers, is software that is responsible for "drawing" and placing the windows on the screen of the user of an operating system, see the image below for an example of Linux Mint. Linux Mint uses so-called Muffin for its window manager software. This piece of software is therefore an important component for the graphical display of the user interface. It is common that you can move these windows, close, enlarge/reduce, close and more. Only some people who find these standard options "old". These people therefore use less obvious window managers.

## Window Managers for advanced users

Like I said, there are many window managers for Linux. In this article I will go further in so-called tiling window managers. These window managers also use "windows", but these do not overlap each other in contrast to the more popular/common way see Linux Mint or Windows 7.

The four most well-known tiling window managers are: i3, Awesome, Xmonad and dwm (**not** sorted by popularity). Why would you deviate from the standard window manager? And what do these tiling window managers offer that other window managers do not offer? Read on quickly.

### Awesome

Awesome is one of the advanced window managers for Linux. Awesome is extremely configurable, fast and extendable. See below some examples:

Awesome, right? ðŸ˜›

As you can see, Awesome looks very different from the more popular window managers. You can configure Awesome via a language called Lua, which is very similar to the Python programming language. In it you can indicate how your screen will look, what you can put where, which key combinations you want to use and much more. What a very powerful aspect of Awesome is that you **do not** need a mouse, everything you can control with your keyboard.

#### Installation & usage

Awesome can be installed via the package manager. In Ubuntu and Linux Mint you can install Awesome via: `sudo apt-get install awesome`

For extra libraries (such as **Vicious**, see later), install: `sudo apt-get install awesome-extra`

By default Ubuntu and Linux Mint use the GDM (Gnome Display Manager) login manager. In that case Awesome is automatically installed in these login managers: GDM (Gnome Display Manager) for Ubuntu or **MDM** (mdm Display Manager) for Linux Mint.

The configuration file is located in your home directory: `nano ~/.config/awesome/rc.lua`

## Xmonad
