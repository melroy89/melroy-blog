Let's compile the Linux kernel from scratch. Change the `.config` file etc.

https://gitlab.melroy.org/melroy/melvalds-linux/

How-to configure. How to compile. And to build the kernel modules. And how to install it.
Also how to build and install the "tools" which are part of the Kernel repository but not build and installed by default.
