Within this short guide I will show you how to set up your own mail server under Linux (Ubuntu Server), which uses your Gmail credentials to send e-mails.
I start by explaining what a **mail server** is and why you would want to set up your own mail server. Then I explain what Postfix is. Finally, the guide concludes with how you can set up your own mail server.

## What is a mail server?

A **mail server** (also known as _mail transfer agent_ or _MTA_) is used to send and/or receive e-mails. Known mail servers are: Microsoft Exchange, qmail, Exim, Sendmail.
A mail server usually runs on a server that is always online or you can also set up your own mail server on your own server or computer.
When you send an e-mail from, for example, Outlook, the e-mail is sent to the mail server, which in turn forwards the e-mail to another mail server.

To receive e-mails, SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is usually used.

### Why?

A self-hosted mail server can be very useful, Postfix mailserver can be used to send e-mails to other mail servers (eg. Gmail). However, you can also fully host your own mail server without the need for a third-party mail server.

Hosting your own mail server isn't easy, you will need to have a static IP address, which is not always the case. Because a static IP allows you to send e-mails to other mail servers without the risk of your e-mail being blocked by a another mail server. Many mail servers are checking if your IP is classified as dynamic. But also configuring DNS records like the PTR record is not always possible when you are using a dynamic IP address.

## What is Postfix?

Postfix is an open-source mail server developed by [IBM research](http://www.research.ibm.com/), and an alternative to Sendmail (which is still widely used).
Sendmail is an old mail server. The first version dates from the 80s. At that time, it was not yet foreseen what the internet would be like, as we know it now.
Postfix therefore offers a nice alternative, however, it is compatible with Sendmail. In addition, Postfix offers more security, speed, robustness and flexibility than Sendmail. It is therefore recommended to use Postfix instead of Sendmail as a mail server.

## How-to

Now that you know the background, I will now show you how to configure Linux to send e-mails yourself via Postfix to any e-mail address. Postfix uses Gmail SMTP credentials to send the e-mail to the specified e-mail address.

We start by installing the necessary packages, via: `sudo apt install postfix mailutils libsasl2-2 ca-certificates libsasl2-modules`

To tell Postfix to relay all messages destined for `*@gmail.com` through Google’s SMTP server, put this into `/usr/local/etc/postfix/transport`:

```sh
gmail.com smtp:[smtp.gmail.com]:587
```

Then, create the `/usr/local/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd` file, telling Postfix to authorize with your Gmail login credentials when connecting to Google’s SMTP server:

```sh
[smtp.gmail.com]:587 _username_@gmail.com:_password_
```

Fix permission and update postfix config to use sasl_passwd file: `sudo chmod 400 /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd`

Then, create the `/usr/local/etc/postfix/tls_policy` file, telling Postfix to use TLS when connecting to Google’s SMTP server:

```
[smtp.gmail.com]:587 encrypt
```

Generate the Postfix database files, using the following commands:

```sh
sudo postmap transport && sudo postmap sasl_passwd && sudo postmap tls_policy
```

In de main.cf file:

```ini
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
smtp_tls_policy_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/tls_policy
smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/postfix/cacert.pem
smtp_use_tls = yes
transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport

relayhost = [smtp.gmail.com]:587
```

`sudo /etc/init.d/postfix stop`

`sudo /etc/init.d/postfix start`

Be sure postfix is running, then reload the configure to be sure:

`sudo /etc/init.d/postfix reload`

Finally, test if Postfix is working by sending a test e-mail to yourself:

```sh
echo "Test mail from postfix" | mail -s "Test Postfix" your@mail.com
```

Of course you have to replace `your@mail.com` with your own email address.

If you get an error message, check the log file: `nano /var/log/mail.log`
