[Bun 1.0](https://bun.sh/) is out of the oven! And it's a big deal, because there wasn't much happening in terms of performance or innovation in the recent years with NodeJS. Sure we have [Deno](https://deno.com/), but who is really using Deno?
Also Bun tries to combine various tools into one tool, helping out the developers a lot.

## Pros

Bun is developed in the [Zig programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zig_(programming_language)). Bun is very focused on performance, which in most cases the Bun Runtime (let's call it buntime ðŸ˜‚) is indeed running faster than NodeJS. Mainly because of Zip and using JavaScriptCore Engine by Apple instead of the V8 JavaScript Engine by Google. Both engines are open-source.

Moreover, Buntime can also run TypeScript directly without the need of `tsc`, so Bun transpiles the code for you. Bun tries to be API and tooling compatible with Node and NPM (more on that later).

I do like the fast [built-in APIs for file IO](https://bun.sh/docs/api/file-io#writing-files-bun-write) which allows you to read or write files from disk. In fact much faster than the NodeJS alternative packages. You also have a [built-in HTTP server](https://bun.sh/docs/api/http) (`Bun.serve`) in Bun. Next, Bun is not only a runtime but also a package manager command to replace the `npm` command. You can now just run: `bun install`, which is indeed fast to be honest.

In Bun you also have top-level await and environment variables are supported out-of-the-box. And Bun even comes with a [built-in test runner](https://bun.sh/docs/cli/test) that is _Jest-compatible_, just execute: `bun test`.

Bun also supports _hot reload_ without the need of Nodemon or other tools, use: `bun --hot` or: `bun --watch`. Try for instance: `bun --watch test`.

Last but not least, Bun allows you to finally **combine** CommonJS and ES modules imports within the same project and file (no need for `"type": "module"` in your `package.json` file and converting all your imports and exports):

```js
import lodash from "lodash";
const _ = require("underscore");
```

Free pro tip:

> If you are using the Express framework experiment with alternative implementations like [Hono](https://hono.dev/) or [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com/), which can handle much more requests per second. For instance using Express with node on JSON Post data gives you an average of `14.361` req/s, while Hono or Elysia using JSON Post data on Bun can go up to respectively `223.139` req/s and `214.370` req/s. Assuming you really need those kind of performances ðŸ˜‰.

## Cons

This all sounds fantastic but are there no down-sides? Yes there are...

When I tried to migrate some of my projects to Bun, I found out that Bun 1.0 wasn't as "production ready" as Bun might tell you.

First of all, the official [`oven/bun` Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/oven/bun) doesn't come with an Alpine Linux version (yet). Meaning all Bun Docker images are almost 100MB in compressed size.  
Changing the `WORKDIR` in my Dockerfile resulted into: 

```bash
Cannot find module ".//app/" from "bun:main"` error.
```

Then I miss the `bun audit` command to my surprise. The `bun outdated` command is missing as well... ðŸ˜¢

The idea is that Bun is a drop-in replacement for both Node and `npm`, but npm advises people to use the `--omit` flag over the previous `--production` flag (eg. `npm install --omit=dev`). Too bad Bun does not have this `--omit` flag, so be sure to use: `bun install --production` (or: `-p` for short) instead. So again bun it not fully compatible with npm.

And when trying to build my JS code using: `bun build`, I got the following error ([the cluster package isn't implemented](https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/nodejs-apis#node-cluster) in Bun yet): 

```bash
Could not resolve Node.js builtin: "cluster". To use Node.js builtins, set target to 'node' or 'bun'
```

Keep in mind Bun will create a binary lock file (`bun.lockb`), if you want to read the content, you need to execute: `bun bun.lockb`. Git diff is therefor also **not** straightforward anymore.

Ps. Do not believe the `bun install` speeds in the official Bun blog post, since they used packages from cache which is not a fair comparison in my opinion. Yes, the `bun install` command is faster then `npm install` command but not always _that_ fast.

## Conclusion

Overall, I recommend trying out Bun for yourself. I think Bun is a great step in the right direction. I think the Bun project with the 1.0 release also woke-up the NodeJS project.

Check for yourself whether Bun is working for you and worth the effort to migrate. I personally can't wait for the above issues to be resolved, since this is a showstopper for me now.
