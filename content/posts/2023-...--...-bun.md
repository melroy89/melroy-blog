Bun 1.0 is out of the oven! And it's a big deal. I also will check-out Hono in favour of Express. 

Let's make JS fast again. Bun is a runtime runs Javascript code and even TS scripts directly (transpiles for you, no tsc required). Fast built-in API (eg. file for reading files very fast from disk or `serve`` for HTTP server). Combine CommonJS and ES Modules. 
Bun is also a package manager (like npm), and bun has a fast built-in test runner. 
And more...

```
bun run start                 # run the `start` script

bun install <pkg>â€‹             # install a package

bun build ./index.tsx         # bundle a project for browsers

bun test                      # run tests

bunx cowsay "Hello, world!"   # execute a package
```
