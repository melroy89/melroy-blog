Bun 1.0 is out of the oven! And it's a big deal. I also will check-out Hono in favour of Express. 

Let's make JS fast again. Bun is a runtime runs Javascript code and even TS scripts directly (transpiles for you, no tsc required). Fast built-in API (eg. file for reading files very fast from disk or `serve`` for HTTP server). Combine CommonJS and ES Modules. Top level await. Env variables and database support out of the box.
Bun is also a package manager (like npm), and bun has a fast built-in test runner. 
And more...

```
bun run start                 # run the `start` script

bun install <pkg>â€‹             # install a package

bun build ./index.tsx         # bundle a project for browsers

bun test                      # run tests

bunx cowsay "Hello, world!"   # execute a package
```


Missing `bun audit`. Missing `bun outdated`. 

Npm advise the `--omit` flag on npm install (eg. `npm install --omit=dev`), but bun install doesn't have this flag yet, so be sure to use: `npm install --production` (or: `-p` for short) instead.

Changing WORKDIR on the oven/bun Docker image results into: Cannot find module ".//app/" from "bun:main". 

There is not yet a Docker Bun Alpine image.

There is no node cluster module equivalent in Bun when execute `bun build`, resulting in: error: Could not resolve Node.js builtin: "cluster". To use Node.js builtins, set target to 'node' or 'bun'.
