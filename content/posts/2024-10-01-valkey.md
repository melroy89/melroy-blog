This guide is focus on moving from Redis to [Valkey](https://valkey.io/) on my Ubuntu Server 24.04. There is no official documentation on how to setup Valkey via the binary, so this guide will help you to get started with Valkey. Which in my case will _replace_ my Redis servers.

If you use Docker, you can simply use the Docker image: `valkey/valkey:8.0.0` (always use tagged versions, at this moment `8.0.0` is the latest stable version).

_Assumption:_ I do assume you have some basic knowledge of Linux and how to use the command line.

## Why Valkey?

Valkey is a data structure server that is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Redis. Valkey uses the same protocol as Redis.  
Moreover, Valkey is very fast and rewritten to a much more modular architecture.

Valkey is a real open-project under the BSD 3-Clause License, while Redis changed their license to [dual license](https://redis.io/legal/licenses/), namely the "Redis Source Available License v2" and "Server Side Public License". _Note:_ Redis calls it "source-available software", which is not the same as "open-source software".
Both of which are _NOT_ compatible with the [OSI definition of open-source software](https://opensource.org/licenses). Do not get fooled! Hence the reason why I'm not using Redis anymore.

There are also great alternatives like [KeyDB](https://docs.keydb.dev/docs/). There aren't many how-to articles about Valkey, so I decided to write this guide.

## Install Valkey

My intention was to use the official Valkey package. Too bad there is no official pre-packaged version for Ubuntu or Debian (and I don't want to use Percona).

Then I tried going to the [official download page](https://valkey.io/download/), the latest link allowed me to download: [Valkey 8.0.0 Focal for x86_64](https://download.valkey.io/releases/valkey-8.0.0-focal-x86_64.tar.gz).

After untarring the file and installing the files to `/usr/local` the Valkey server does works...  
But, I'm using systemd on my Ubuntu Server, and the binary artifact from Valkey is giving me issues, because the binaries are build without systemd support. [See upstream discussion](https://github.com/orgs/valkey-io/discussions/1103).

Meaning the provided standalone binaries are not suitable for running production with systemd. Thus we will be building from source-code ðŸ˜¬.

### Build Valkey from source

Install prerequisites:

```sh
sudo apt install -y build-essential git libsystemd-dev libssl-dev
```

Clone the git repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey.git
```

Go to the directory:

```bash
cd valkey
```

We could go to the tagged version (`git checkout tags/8.0.0`), but I like to go to the `8.0` branch:

```bash
git checkout 8.0
```

Optionally, clean the directory (useful if you need to rebuild):

```bash
make clean
make distclean
```

Build the binaries with systemd support and TLS support. `-j10` is the number of parallel build jobs.

I also do not want to create symlinks for Redis to Valkey, so it should leave Redis alone. However, if you do want symlinks, then remove: `USE_REDIS_SYMLINKS=no`.

```bash
make -j10 USE_SYSTEMD=yes BUILD_TLS=yes USE_REDIS_SYMLINKS=no
```

Finally install the binaries to the default `/usr/local/bin` directory:

```bash
sudo make install
```

## Prepare users and directories

Let's create a dedicated `valkey` user and group:

```bash
sudo groupadd valkey
sudo useradd -g valkey valkey
```

Create a `/var/lib/valkey` directory, we will use it later!

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/valkey
sudo chown -R valkey:valkey /var/lib/valkey
```

And also create a `/var/run/valkey` directory, you will later need for PID file as well as storing the socket file:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/run/valkey
sudo chown -R valkey:valkey /var/run/valkey
```

## Setup systemd service

Since we're using Valkey as a standalone binary, we'll need to create our own systemd service file in order to start Valkey on boot.

Let's create a systemd service file within the: `/usr/lib/systemd/system` directory. Luckily, we can find a [systemd service example](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/blob/613e4e028f23af40c9308f8dbce82c6c67593123/utils/systemd-valkey_server.service) in the official Valkey repository.

```bash
sudo nano /usr/lib/systemd/system/valkey-server.service
```

With the following content:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Valkey data structure server
Documentation=https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-doc
AssertPathExists=/var/lib/valkey
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/valkey-server /etc/valkey/valkey.conf --supervised systemd --daemonize no
LimitNOFILE=10032
NoNewPrivileges=yes
#OOMScoreAdjust=-900
PrivateTmp=yes
Type=notify
TimeoutStartSec=infinity
TimeoutStopSec=infinity
UMask=0077
User=valkey
Group=valkey
WorkingDirectory=/var/lib/valkey

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Once you created the systemd file, like above, we reload the systemd manager:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

## Create Valkey Configuration file

Now that we have the systemd service file, we can create a configuration file.

And create the config directory:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/valkey
sudo chown -R valkey:valkey /etc/valkey
```

I will use the conf file from the official Valkey repository again: [valkey.conf](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/blob/613e4e028f23af40c9308f8dbce82c6c67593123/valkey.conf).

```bash
sudo nano /etc/valkey/valkey.conf
```

With the RAW content from the valkey.conf file mentioned earlier above.

I made several changes to the configuration file thus far:

```diff
# Change the PID file directory location (mainly to avoid permission issues)
-pidfile /var/run/valkey_6379.pid
+pidfile /var/run/valkey/valkey_6379.pid

# Enable Unix socket file with 777 permissions (if you want)
+unixsocket /var/run/valkey/valkey.sock
+unixsocketperm 777

# Set a memory limit
+maxmemory 1GB

# Set a memory limit policy
+maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru

# Optionally enable io-threads (if you want)
+io-threads 4

# Optionally decrease the keep alive (again if you want)
+tcp-keepalive 120
```

---

Finally, set the rights correctly on the file:

```bash
sudo chown valkey:valkey /etc/valkey/valkey.conf
```

## Starting Valkey

Valkey configuration by default will use TCP port 6379, which is the default port for Redis as well. Meaning if you are still running running Redis, stop the Redis service first.

Start Valkey via:

```bash
sudo systemctl start valkey-server
```

See if it runs correctly:

```bash
sudo systemctl status valkey-server
```

Can you connect to the server? Let's try:

```bash
valkey-cli
```
