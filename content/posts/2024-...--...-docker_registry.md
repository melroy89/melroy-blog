# Running a Docker Registry

Running your own Docker registry is a great way to cache images from DockerHub. This is especially useful if your network is slow or unstable or if you want to cache images from CI/CD pipelines.

## Docker Compose file

Below an example of a Docker Compose file for running your own a Docker registry, I use this as a cache for pulling images from DockerHub:

```yaml
services:
  registry:
    image: registry:2
    container_name: registry
    restart: always
    networks:
      - registry_external_network
    environment:
      - REGISTRY_PROXY_REMOTEURL=https://registry-1.docker.io
      - REGISTRY_PROXY_USERNAME=your_username
      - REGISTRY_PROXY_PASSWORD=secret
    volumes:
      - /media/data/registry:/var/lib/registry
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:5000:5000"

networks:
  registry_external_network:
```

Change the `REGISTRY_PROXY_USERNAME` and `REGISTRY_PROXY_PASSWORD` to your DockerHub credentials.
I provide my username & password to [increase the rate limit on the DockerHub registry](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/) to 200 pulls per 6 hours.

In the example above I will mount the registry data directory from the container (`/var/lib/registry`) to `/media/data/registry` on my server.
You might want to change this to a different location on your server.

## Docker Daemon configuration

Change the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file (create the file if it does not exist). And add the following two lines:

```json
{
  // ....
  "registry-mirrors": ["http://127.0.0.1:5000"],
  "insecure-registries": ["127.0.0.1:5000"]
}
```

Do not panic about the `insecure-registries` option, this is required because the registry container is running on HTTP (without SSL).

## My full Docker configuration

My full `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file looks like this:

```json
{
  "experimental": false,
  "icc": false,
  "userns-remap": "default",
  "storage-driver": "overlay2",
  "userland-proxy": false,
  "live-restore": false,
  "no-new-privileges": true,
  "dns": ["1.1.1.1", "208.67.222.222", "8.8.8.8"],
  "ipv6": false,
  "registry-mirrors": ["http://127.0.0.1:5000"],
  "insecure-registries": ["127.0.0.1:5000"],
  "data-root": "/media/data_extra/docker",
  "bip": "10.254.1.1/24",
  "default-address-pools": [{ "base": "10.254.0.0/16", "size": 25 }]
}
```

I changed some options for hardening Docker containers, like `icc`, `no-new-privileges` and `userns-remap`.

I also changed the default bridge network (`"bip": "10.254.1.1/24"`),

And I changed the default address pool to use the `10.254.0.0/16` base, and set the default address pool to: `10.254.0.0/16` with 25 CIDR mask size.
Meaning, I will have 65534 IP addresses (`/16`) for the bridge network. And for each Docker network can have 126 IP addresses (`25` CIDR mask size).

A simple calculation: `65534 / 126 = 520` Docker networks before I run out of IP addresses.
