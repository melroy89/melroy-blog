This guide is focus on moving from Redis to [Valkey](https://valkey.io/) on my Ubuntu Server 24.04. There is no official documentation on how to setup Valkey via the binary, so this guide will help you to get started with Valkey. Which in my case will _replace_ my Redis servers.

If you use Docker, you can simply use the Docker image: `valkey/valkey:8.0.0` (always use tagged versions, at this moment `8.0.0` is the latest stable version).

_Assumption:_ I do assume you have some basic knowledge of Linux and how to use the command line.

## Why Valkey?

Valkey is a data structure server that is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Redis. Valkey uses the same protocol as Redis.  
Moreover, Valkey is very fast and rewritten to a much more modular architecture.

Valkey is a real open-project under the BSD 3-Clause License, while Redis changed their license to [dual license](https://redis.io/legal/licenses/), namely the "Redis Source Available License v2" and "Server Side Public License". _Note:_ Redis calls it "source-available software", which is not the same as "open-source software".
Both of which are _NOT_ compatible with the [OSI definition of open-source software](https://opensource.org/licenses). Do not get fooled! Hence the reason why I'm not using Redis anymore.

There are also great alternatives like [KeyDB](https://docs.keydb.dev/docs/). There aren't many how-to articles about Valkey, so I decided to write this guide.

## Install Valkey

My intention was to use the official Valkey package. Too bad there is no official pre-packaged version for Ubuntu or Debian (and I don't want to use Percona).

Luckily, they do have a binary download from the [official download page](https://valkey.io/download/), the latest link allowed me to download: [Valkey 8.0.1 Focal for x86_64](https://download.valkey.io/releases/valkey-8.0.1-focal-x86_64.tar.gz). Although I'm using Ubuntu 24.04, the focal binary works fine.

Well, the binaries are now working after fixing two issues: [PR #1106](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/pull/1106) and [PR #1107](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/pull/1107), which are part of the patch release `8.0.1`.

Installation is pretty straight forward, just extract the file and move the files to `/usr/local`:

```bash
# Untar
tar -xzf valkey-8.0.1-focal-x86_64.tar.gz

# Go to directory
cd valkey-8.0.1-focal-x86_64/

# Copy files
sudo cp -R . /usr/local/
```

## Prepare users and directories

Let's create a dedicated `valkey` user and group:

```bash
sudo groupadd valkey
sudo useradd -g valkey valkey
```

Create a `/var/lib/valkey` directory, we will use it later!

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/valkey
sudo chown -R valkey:valkey /var/lib/valkey
```

And also create a `/var/run/valkey` directory, you will later need for PID file as well as storing the socket file:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/run/valkey
sudo chown -R valkey:valkey /var/run/valkey
```

## Setup systemd service

Since we're using Valkey as a standalone binary, we'll need to create our own systemd service file in order to start Valkey on boot.

Let's create a systemd service file within the: `/usr/lib/systemd/system` directory. Luckily, we can find a [systemd service example](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/blob/unstable/utils/systemd-valkey_server.service) in the official Valkey repository, using the `unstable` branch. Which doesn't mean this file is unstable, but you will just get the latest version.

```bash
sudo nano /usr/lib/systemd/system/valkey-server.service
```

With the following content:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Valkey data structure server
Documentation=https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-doc
AssertPathExists=/var/lib/valkey
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/valkey-server /etc/valkey/valkey.conf --supervised systemd --daemonize no
LimitNOFILE=10032
NoNewPrivileges=yes
OOMScoreAdjust=-900
PrivateTmp=yes
Type=notify
TimeoutStartSec=infinity
TimeoutStopSec=infinity
UMask=0077
User=valkey
Group=valkey
WorkingDirectory=/var/lib/valkey

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Once you created the systemd file, like above, we reload the systemd manager:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

## Create Valkey Configuration file

Now that we have the systemd service file, we can create a configuration file.

And create the config directory:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/valkey
sudo chown -R valkey:valkey /etc/valkey
```

I will use the conf file from the official Valkey repository again: [valkey.conf](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/blob/unstable/valkey.conf) (from the `unstable` branch).

```bash
sudo nano /etc/valkey/valkey.conf
```

With the RAW content from the valkey.conf file mentioned earlier above.

---

I made several changes to the configuration file thus far:

```diff
# Change the PID file directory location (mainly to avoid permission issues)
-pidfile /var/run/valkey_6379.pid
+pidfile /var/run/valkey/valkey_6379.pid

# Enable Unix socket file with 777 permissions (if you want)
+unixsocket /var/run/valkey/valkey.sock
+unixsocketperm 777

# Set a memory limit
+maxmemory 1GB

# Set a memory limit policy
+maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru

# Optionally enable io-threads (if you want)
+io-threads 4

# Optionally decrease the keep alive (again if you want)
+tcp-keepalive 120
```

---

Finally, set the rights correctly on the file:

```bash
sudo chown valkey:valkey /etc/valkey/valkey.conf
```

## Starting Valkey

Valkey configuration by default will use TCP port 6379, which is the default port for Redis as well. Meaning if you are still running running Redis, stop the Redis service first.

Start Valkey via:

```bash
sudo systemctl start valkey-server
```

See if it runs correctly:

```bash
sudo systemctl status valkey-server
```

Can you connect to the server? Let's try:

```bash
valkey-cli
```

Now you can type for more details about this specific server:

```bash
INFO server
```

Cool huh? Welcome to Valkey!

---

Assuming you have an application that uses Valkey (which again can just use the Redis RESP protocol). And the application inserted some data, you can then validate if the data is present:

```bash
# Again via the same valkey-cli tool
valkey-cli

# Now type:
KEYS *
```

If there is any data stored, you will see a list of the keys.
