Right to repair. Explain why it's important: it's good for your wallet, it's better for the planet and thus more sustainable. Less e-waste.
10/10 iFixit score.

Examples: Framework laptop, Fairphone, Etc. PLanning to buy a Framework 16 and Fairphone 5 to replace my old laptop from 2008 and my phone from 2016.
