I loved firefox. Using Firefox since I was a kid. I'm using Firefox as my main browser for 24 years! Which is why it's so said that I'm leaving Firefox.

Firefox was standing for providing a good alternative to Google Chrome. And Firefox was all about open-source and privacy. But no longer, since the new SEO takeover of Mozilla, Mozilla took over an advertising company. Meaning that Mozilla is now very simular to what Google is doing.

Soon after that, Mozilla started to make Firefox privacy friendly by providing Mozilla details of Firefox. While Mozilla is now also a advertising company...

Luckily there are many good Firefox forks out there.

Alternatives to Firefox:

- LibreWolf
- Floorp
- WaterFox
- Mullvad

I'm using the Floorp browser now, which is a fork of Firefox with tons of extra features and privacy features.

Keep in mind that both Brave and Vivaldi are based on Chromium, so you might want to avoid those.
