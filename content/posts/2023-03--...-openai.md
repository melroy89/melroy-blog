Dangerous of OpenAI: No just singulary.. lol
But also monopoly isn't a good thing with AIs.
Next, is that it often returns an incorrect and wrong answer.
Futhermore, the AI has is quite baised, politically and in other views of the world. And since these AIs just give you a single answer, people might think that is this the only truth.
But just like journalism a story always have two sides. If people get lazy with ChatGPT or Bing AI, people might stop doing propper research and make up their own mind.
