Transpiler Typescript 70x faster than `tsc` compiler by using `swc`. SWC is written in Rust and part of a bigger project with the aim to improve the JS/TS development platform... speed up the development cycle.. etc.

Install depedencies for SWC via `npm` (or `pnpm` if you wish):

```sh
npm -i -D @swc/cli @swc/core
```

Example of a `.swcrc` file:

```

```

Using tsconfig.json file.

Important: SWC only transpiles the code and doesn't perform type checking. Hence it's important to also still use `tsc` for type checking for example by including that in package.json and make it part of our CI/CD workflow.

For development (eg. a development instance) you can leverage the `ts-node` project, which tranforms TypeScript to Javascript in memory, without writing the JS files to disk. Using ts-node together with nodemon can also be very handy. Then you can configure `ts-node` to use SWC by setting the the following options in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "ts-node": {
    "swc": true
  }
}
```
