# Setup NSD & Unbound DNS servers

I'm using Ubuntu Server 24.04 is this example.

## NSD

I will start with setting-up NSD (Name Server Daemon), which is an authoritative DNS server. Let's install NSD:

```sh
sudo apt install nsd
```

The default port NSD will try to use is port `53`. However, port 53 is already reserved by either systemd-resolve or in our case when we later will install Unbound recursive DNS server. We change the port by editing `/etc/nsd/nsd.conf` more info can be found by running `man nsd.conf`:

```ini
server:
  # Change default port
  port: 5353

  # log only to syslog.
  log-only-syslog: yes
```

Next, I want to make some additional small changes. I want to start two sub-processes in order to use two of my cores (if needed).  
I also want to explicitly set the username to change to `nsd` for security reasons. Now `/etc/nsd/nsd.conf` looks like this:

```ini
server:
  # Change default port
  port: 5353
  server-count: 2
  username: nsd
  # log only to syslog.
  log-only-syslog: yes
```

### PID file

If you are also like to use a PID (process ID) files? Which can be useful when used together with Monit for monitoring services. Then follow this section, otherwise skip this optional section.


Add `pidfile: /var/run/nsd/nsd.pid` to the `/etc/nsd/nsd.conf` config:

```ini
server:
  ...
  pidfile: /var/run/nsd/nsd.pid
```

Edit the `/usr/lib/systemd/system/nsd.service` file and remove `-P ""`:

```diff
-ExecStart=/usr/sbin/nsd -d -P ""
+ExecStart=/usr/sbin/nsd -d
```

Otherwise a PID file will still not be written to disk ðŸ˜–.

Now run since we changed a service file:

```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

This is the end of the PID section.

### Remote control

Why remote control..? TODO: Explain.

Since I have IPv6 disabled on my server via sysctl, it fail to start because NSD by default try to enable remote control on both IPV4 and IPV6 interfaces (apparently, only when using Ubuntu).

Running a remote-control interface is fine, but again since I only use IPV4, I change the config to listen on only 127.0.0.1 (I also set `control-enable: yes` explicitly just to be sure):

```ini
server:
  ... # See above

# Remote control section
remote-control:
  control-enable: yes
  # Only bind on IPv4
  control-interface: 127.0.0.1
```

## Zones

Now we could try to setup a simple zone for let's say our *.home domains internally. Of course NSD can be used for real domains as well, giving you full control over all DNS records. But let's start small here.

We will edit the same `/etc/nsd/nsd.conf` file and add a new zone:

```ini
zone:
    name: home
    zonefile: "home.zone"
```

As you notice we declared a `zonefile`, but we didn't create one yet. So let's do that now:

Create a new file at: `/etc/nsd/home.zone`, with the content:

```ini
; /usr/local/etc/nsd/home.zone
$ORIGIN home. ; 'default' domain as FQDN for this zone
$TTL 600 ; default time-to-live for this zone

; The at sign below is just a quick way of referring to our origin, in our case home.
@   IN  SOA     ns1.home. admin.home. (
        2024102301  ;Serial number (aka version, often use date)
        7200        ;Refresh
        3600        ;Retry
        1209600     ;Expire
        3600        ;Negative response caching TTL
)

; The nameserver that are authoritative for this zone.
                NS      ns1.home.
; A records are for IPv4  
firewall.home.  A       192.168.1.1
server.home.    A       192.168.1.42
melroy.home.    A       192.168.1.116
htpc.home.      A       192.168.1.110
ns1             A       192.168.1.42
```

Notice all the dots at the end (like `home.`), this is required. Like explained at the top of this article, the `.` is the root of DNS.

Now you can try to restart NSD:

```sh
sudo systemctl restart nsd.service
```

TODO: NSD Reverse zone configuration? Like: https://calomel.org/nsd_dns.html

TODO: Should we use `IN` or not in the zone file? Is it optional?

TODO: Should we use `melroy.home.` or just `melroy`?
