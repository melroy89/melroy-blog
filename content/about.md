Hi ðŸ‘‹, My name is Melroy van den Berg.  
I'm a software engineer & DevOps architect from The Netherlands.

You might want to also [visit my homepage](https://melroy.org).

## Passion

My passion has always been technology and computers in the broadest sense.

I have been involved in software development from a young age. What I made my profession out of, with knowledge about many programming language, software testing and many other technical subjects.  
In recent years I have also enjoyed discovering a different side of IT landscape apart from software development. Currently, I'm a DevOps architect as my day job for ASML.

I _love_ contributing to open-source projects and free software ([Free as in freedom](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), not free bear), [check-out my GitHub profile](https://github.com/melroy89).

## Projects

As stated earlier, I'm actually both maintaining and contributing many different open-source projects as well as the creator or several open-source projects.
